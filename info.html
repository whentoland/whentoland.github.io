		WhenToLand - Land time voltage calculator
	</h1>
	<h2>
		WhenToLand calculates the theoretical voltage, amps and time at which you need to start landing
	</h2>
	<h3>
		<br>
		The results shown are based on average performance of a variety of typical RC batteries. However note that each battery and each setup behaves differently so use these estimates as guidance and then fine tune them on your setup.
		<br><br>
		A couple of key assumptions:
		<ul>
			<li>If you enter a drain of over 25C, for calculation purposes it is assumed that the drain is 25C</li>
			<li>The voltage drop of LiPos under load at different C levels as well as the percentage capacity in relation to voltage has been calculated as an average from a dozen online sources</li>
			<li>It is assumed that its time to land at when the LiPo has 25% of its Amps left</li>
		</ul><br><br>
		Please feel free to send any and all feedback on how to improve the site and requests for changes or additions to the >assumptions used.
